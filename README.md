# nChronic.Core

## Introduction

A natural language date parser for .Net Standard written in C#. Originally written by Mike Schrag as a direct port of Ruby's Chronic, later ported to .NET by [Robert Wilczynski](https://github.com/robertwilczynski), and finally migrated to .NET Standard by [Rob Bell](https://github.com/robbell).

DateTime.Now; 
  //=> Sun Aug 27 23:18:25 PDT 2006

var parser = new Parser();
parser.Parse("tomorrow");

// Setting context
parser = new Parser(new Options { Context = Pointer.Type.Past });
